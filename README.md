# hello-world
Ordo's first repository for ideas and random junk that has no place else to go.

Ordo (that's me) is an 18 year old fledgeling developer that's going into Computer Engineering at college fall 2016. This place is just a collection of things he's doing at random intervals in an effort to teach himself to code in various languages.
